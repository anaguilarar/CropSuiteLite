# Evidence

The *Atlas Solutions* module is designed to help identify and evaluate adaptation strategies that can mitigate the impacts of climate change on crop suitability.  
Some of these strategies focus on scenarios where improved, more stress-tolerant crop varieties—such as drought-tolerant or heat-tolerant cultivars—are introduced.

To identify appropriate maximum thresholds for these improved varieties, we performed a two-step evidence review process:

1.  **AI-Assisted Exploration:** An initial literature screening using Large Language Models (LLM) to identify potential crop-specific temperature and precipitation thresholds.
2. **Manual filtering and validation** of all proposed sources to ensure that only real, scientifically reliable references were included.

The validated parameters and their corresponding sources are summarized in the table below:
